	<h1>Basic</h1>
	<p>These are the fundamentals.</p>
	<div class="inset1" class="basics laws">
		<h2>The Laws</h2>
		<p>There are many laws when it comes to UI/UX. But we will be touch just the bare essentials here.</p>
			<div class="inset2">
				<h3>Miller's Law</h3>
				<p>Miller’s law teaches us to use chunking to organize content into smaller clusters to help users process, understand,
					and memorize easily. The longer it is, the less of it people will read.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Chunking Information: Break down complex information into smaller "chunks" or groups of related items. This
						can help
						users process and remember the content more effectively. For instance, when presenting a list of features,
						divide them
						into meaningful categories or groups of three to five items each.</li>

					<li>Use Visual Hierarchy: Employ visual hierarchy to guide users' attention and help them understand the
						relationships
						between different pieces of content. Larger fonts, bold text, contrasting colors, and strategic placement
						can all help
						emphasize important information.</li>

					<li>Progressive Disclosure: Instead of overwhelming users with a multitude of options or details all at once,
						consider using
						progressive disclosure. Start with essential information and provide options for users to delve deeper into
						more
						detailed content if they choose to.</li>

					<li>Simplify Navigation: Limit the number of navigation options and categories to a manageable amount. If you
						have a complex
						website with numerous sections, consider using drop-down menus, subcategories, or search functionalities to
						help users
						find what they're looking for.</li>

					<li>Clear and Concise Language: Use concise and straightforward language to convey your message. Avoid
						unnecessary jargon
						and complicated phrasing that can strain user's working memory.</li>

					<li>Visual Aids: Incorporate visual aids such as icons, images, and diagrams to assist in conveying information
						more
						efficiently. Visual elements can enhance comprehension and reduce the cognitive load on users.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="inset2">
				<h3>Fitts' Law</h3>
				<p>The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Touch targets should be large enough for users to accurately select them. - WCAG recommends <span class="note">minimum of 44 × 44 CSS px</span>.</li>
				<li>Touch targets should have ample spacing between them. - google's material design recommends <span class="note">touch targets should be separated by 8 dp minimum</span>.</li>
				<li>Touch targets should be placed in areas of an interface that allow them to be easily acquired - turns out people <span class="note">prefer to touch the middle of the screen</span> more than the edges.</li>
			</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="inset2">
				<h3>Jacob's Law</h3>
				<p>Users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites
					they already know.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that appears similar.</li>
					<li>By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the users can focus on their tasks rather than on learning new models.</li>
					<li>When making changes, minimize discomfort by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited time.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="inset2">
				<h3>Doherty Threshold</h3>
				<p>Productivity soars when a computer and its users interact at a pace ( &#60;400 ms) that ensures that neither has to
					wait on the other.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Provide system feedback within 400 ms in order to keep users’
					attention and increase productivity.</li>
					<li>Use perceived performance to improve response time and reduce
					the perception of waiting.</li>
					<li>Animation is one way to visually engage people while loading or
					processing is happening in the background.</li>
					<li>Progress bars help make wait times tolerable, regardless of their
					accuracy.</li>
					<li>Purposefully adding a delay to a process can actually increase its
					perceived value and instill a sense of trust, even when the process
					itself actually takes much less time.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="inset2">
				<h3>Law of Proximity/ Similarity/ Common Region/ Continuity</h3>
				<p>Place elements that belong together closer to one another. Similar elements are perceived as belonging together.
				Use similar color, spacing and size for such elements. Try to put to well defined border around the similar elements.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="inset2">
				<h3>Law of Closure</h3>
				<p>Refers to the human tendency to perceive incomplete or fragmented visual elements as complete objects. In terms of web
				design, the law of closure suggests that users will mentally fill in the gaps and complete shapes or patterns that are
				not fully defined. This principle can be applied to create visually pleasing and intuitive web interfaces.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="inset2">
				<h3>Law of Figure and Ground</h3>
				<p>Visuals are either a figure or as a background element. Design pages with clear foreground and
				background, this helps users
				decide what to focus on.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="inset2">
				<h3>Law of symmetry</h3>
				<p>Humans prefer symmetry and that's why they call you ugly.
				Symmetry creates an impression of stability and order and can also support a clear structure of content.</p>

		<div class="inset1" class="basics Accessibility">
			<h2>Accessibility</h2>
			<p>The internet is a crucial part of modern life, providing access to information, services, education,
				entertainment, and more. Ensuring that websites are accessible allows people with disabilities to participate fully in online activities, promoting equal access and inclusivity. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) provide a globally recognized framework for creating accessible web content.</p>
			<div class="inset2">
				<h3>Color Contrast</h3>
				<p>The World Wide Web Consortium (2016) recommends a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 to the background for small texts and a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 for large texts (from 14 pt bold /18 pt normal print). The contrast can be checked, for example, on the website
					<a alt="takes you to a website called contrastchecker.com" href="https://contrastchecker.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">contrastchecker.com</a></p>
			</div>
			<div class="inset2">
				<h3>Appropriate Line Spacing and Letter-Spacing</h3>
				<p>The appropriate line spacing (also known as line height) and letter spacing (also known as tracking) for a
					website's text can have a significant impact on its readability and accessibility.</p>
					<h4>Line Spacing (Line Height)</h4>
					<p>Lines that are excessively long can be challenging to read because readers struggle to trace back to the
						start of the next line. Conversely, overly short lines can create a disjointed reading experience, prompting readers to skip back and forth frequently.<span class="note"> The ideal line length typically falls between 50 to 75 characters per line, including spaces.</span> This range is considered optimal for most reading scenarios, as it allows readers to easily follow the text without losing their pace.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><span class="note">Avoid Crowded Text:</span> Line spacing should be generous enough to prevent text from feeling crowded or cramped. This makes it easier for users to distinguish between lines of text.</li>
						<li>Balanced Spacing: Aim for a balance between too much and too little line spacing. Too much spacing can make it challenging for users to connect lines of text, while too little spacing can cause lines to blend together.</li>
						<li>Readability: Ensure that lines of text do not overlap or touch each other, as this can impede readability.</li>
						<li>Consistency: Maintain consistent line spacing throughout your website for a harmonious reading experience. In general, a line spacing of 1.4 to 1.6 times the font size is a common guideline to follow.</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Letter Spacing (Tracking)</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Avoid Excessive Tracking: Letter spacing that is too wide can make text difficult to read, as words lose their cohesion and become disjointed.</li>

						<li>Natural and Readable: Aim for a letter spacing that maintains the natural flow of words while providing a little extra room between letters for clarity.</li>

						<li>Font Consideration: Some fonts inherently require more or less letter spacing due to their design. Choose fonts that are designed with readability in mind, and adjust letter spacing accordingly.</li>

						<li>Consistency: As with line spacing, maintain a consistent letter spacing across your website's text to create a cohesive visual experience.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="inset2">
				<h3>Minimum Font size</h3>
				<p>Text should have a <span class="note">minimum font size of 16 pixels (roughly 12 points)</span> for body
					text. This ensures that most users,including those with mild visual impairments, can read the text without
					needing to zoom in.<br> <span class="note">Use relative units like percentages (%) or "em" units</span>
					instead of fixed pixel values for font sizes. This enables the font to adjust proportionally to the user's
					preferred text size settings.</p>

	<div class="inset1" class="basics Compatibility">
		<h2>Compatibility</h2>
		<p>If it is an e-commerce site then it should be designed to work on all devices available without breaking
			anything. However if it is a education site and provide hand's on learning there will be a level of complexity
			that can't be abstracted away (Tesler’s Law), in that case you can keep the website limited to desktop
			experience.</p>
		<div class="inset2">
			<h3>On the Grid</h3>
			<p>What is Grid? <a alt="link takes you to css-tricks tutorial website"
					href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">A
					Complete Guide to CSS Grid</a></p>

		</div>
		<div class="inset2">
			<h3>Breakpoints</h3>
			<p>Breakpoints in web design refer to specific screen widths at which the layout of a website or web application adjusts to
			provide an optimal user experience. These breakpoints are crucial for creating responsive designs that adapt to various
			devices, screen sizes, and orientations. By defining breakpoints, you can ensure that your content remains readable and
			usable across a wide range of devices, from smartphones to large desktop monitors. They are used to apply rules to elements such as Font Sizes, Navigation, Cropped or dynamically-resized Images & Videos.
				<span class="note">Breakpoints are typically defined using media queries in CSS.</span>
			</p>
			<code>
			/* extra small screens (up to 576px) */
			<br>@media (max-width: 576px) {
			/* CSS rules for Extra Small screens */
			}

			<br>/* small screens (577px to 768px) */
			<br>@media (min-width: 577px) and (max-width: 768px) {
			/* CSS rules for Small screens */
			}

			<br>/* medium screens (769px to 992px) */
			<br>@media (min-width: 769px) and (max-width: 992px) {
			/* CSS rules for Medium screens */
			}

			<br>/* Large screens (993px to 1200px) */
			<br>@media (min-width: 993px) and (max-width: 1200px) {
			/* CSS rules for large screens */
			}

			<br>/* Extra Large screens (1201px and above) */
			<br>@media (max-width: 1201px) {
			/* CSS rules for Extra Large screens */
			}
		</code>

	<div class="inset1" class="basics Clarity">
	<h2>Clarity</h2>
	<p>What is the purpose of your website? What is the message you want to send? What is the action you want the visitors to perform?</p>
	<div class="inset2">
	<h3>Using white space</h3>
	<p>White space refers to the negative space left intentionally to let the design breathe.</p>
	<a href="https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/white-space-in-design-important-guidelines-every-designer-should-know-3efae5594e31" rel="noopener" target="_blank">This article puts it nicely together.</a>
	</div>
	<div class="inset2">
	<h3>by size and placement</h3>
	<p>Make the most important thing the largest and give it the most prominent position on the website. Using bold and catchy fonts like display fonts.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="inset2">
	<h3>by color choice</h3>
	<p>Using contrasting colors are great for calling attention to one over the other. We can use some colors sparingly to add emphasis to them (more in the 60-30-10 rule section).</p>
	</div>
	<div class="inset2">
	<h3>by depth</h3>
	<p>you can add depth to an object by ,adding fake shadows behind it, adding blur to the objects in the background and foreground, using layers.
	</p>
	</div>
	<div class="inset2">
	<h3>by reading patterns</h3>
	<p>"There are four text-scanning patterns: the F-pattern, spotted, layer cake, and commitment patterns. Know that most users will read
	very little from a wall of text; support them by chunking your content into sections and bulleted lists, by using
	meaningful subheadings, and by special visual styling for keywords." - Nielsen Norman Group, Text Scanning Patterns: Eyetracking Evidence.</p>
	<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/text-scanning-patterns-eyetracking/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Read about the research findings here.</a>
	</div>
	<div class="inset2">
	<h3>by Proximity and reputation</h3>
	<p>Move things closer or farther apart based on their relation to one another. Putting all related items together helps to view them as one group rather than several unrelated elements. Visitor should never have to work to put the information together.</p>
	use the neuralink example.

	</div>
	<div class="inset2">
		<h3>Accordions - hide supplementary content</h3>
		<p>Accordions are a common UI pattern used in web design to hide and reveal content in a collapsible manner. They're
		particularly useful when you have content that might be less important or supplementary, allowing users to focus on
		what's essential while still providing access to additional information.</p>
		<p>Commonly used for FAQs, Product Details and Descriptions, Tutorials and Documentation, User Profiles and Dashboards, Mobile Navigation, Privacy Policies and Terms of Service, Filters and Search Options.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="note">Use Clear Titles</span> Provide clear and concise titles for each accordion section. The title should give users a hint about the content
			within, helping them make informed decisions about whether to expand it.</li>
			<li><span class="note">Mobile-Friendly Design</span> Accordions are especially useful on mobile devices where screen space is limited. They allow users to easily expand and
			collapse content sections without overwhelming the screen.</li>
			<li><span class="note">Animation and Indicators</span> Include a subtle animation when opening or closing an accordion section. Also, use visual indicators like arrows or "+"
			and "-" signs to show which sections can be expanded or collapsed.</li>
			<li><span class="note">Avoid Overuse</span> While accordions can help manage content, be cautious not to overuse them. If there's only a small amount of content in
			an accordion, it might be better to display it without collapsing it.</li>
			<li><span class="note">Maintain Accessibility</span> Ensure that the accordion interactions are accessible to all users, including those who use screen readers or keyboard
			navigation. Use appropriate ARIA attributes to convey the state of the accordion to assistive technologies.</li>
			<li><span class="note">Progressive Disclosure</span> Consider the concept of progressive disclosure, where you present information in layers. Users can access more detailed
			information as they choose, which helps prevent overwhelming them with too much information at once.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="inset2">
		<h3>Color</h3>
		<p>The colors used on a website should harmonize well with each other. Use <a
				alt="link takes you to adobe's color-wheel website" href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Adobe
				Color wheel</a>, and <a href="https://realtimecolors.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">realtimecolors</a>.</p>
		<h4>60-30-10 rule</h4>
		<p>Adhere to the 60-30-10 guideline for direction.
			As per this guideline, a layout should encompass 60% neutral color (such as the background), 30% contrasting color
			(used
			for headers, for example), and 10% accent color (employed in elements like call-to-action buttons). This division
			not
			only establishes a visual hierarchy but also fosters a harmonious color interplay.</p>
		<h4>Harmonious Gradients</h4>
		<p>For optimal results, stick to monochromatic or analogous colors for color transitions. When dealing with
			complementary colors, seamless color progressions devoid of grayish patches can be accomplished by introducing a hue
			that sits between the complementary colors on the color wheel.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="inset2">
		<h3>Alignment</h3>
		<p>Align objects with the edge of other objects to make them look clean and harmonious.</p>
		<h4>Center Alignment</h4>
		<p>for paragraph, keep it limited to one or two liner paragraphs.</p>

		<h4>Left Alignment</h4>
		<p>for paragraph, languages that read left to right should use this Alignment.</p>
		<p></p>
		<h4>Right Alignment</h4>
		<p>for paragraph, languages that read right to left should use this Alignment.</p>
		</ul>
	</div>
		<div class="inset2">
			<h3>Symmetrical Balance</h3>
			<p>balance is achieved by placing elements equally on either side of a central axis.</p>
			<h3>Asymmetrical Balance</h3>
			<p>involves skillfully arranging objects varying in size, color, or shape to achieve equilibrium in visual weight, even
			with their differences. For instance, a sizable yet empty object can be counterbalanced by a smaller, but denser, filled
			object. This type of balance imbues designs with a heightened sense of dynamism and intrigue, evoking feelings of motion
			and vitality, which often surpass the static nature of symmetrical balance.</p>
			<h3>Radial</h3>
			<p>Generating radial balance requires the establishment of a focal point, around which the remaining elements find
			equilibrium. This can be accomplished by arranging objects, colors, or textures at equidistant intervals from the
			center, or by orchestrating a spiral pattern that either converges toward or diverges from the central point. As the
			focal point garners the most attention, web designers frequently designate it for pivotal components like CTAs or other
			essential clickable elements.

			<br>Notably, radial balance finds its application in pricing pages, effectively spotlighting a specific pricing model.
			Designers commonly employ variations in size or color to emphasize the central point. This approach echoes Hick's law,
			asserting that the time spent making a decision is directly linked to the number of available choices.</p>
		</div>
	</div>


	<div class="inset1" class="basics identity">
	<h2>Identity</h2>
	<p>What sets a website apart? How come we can instantly recognize an openAI or nothing webpage without even looking at the url or their logo on the page? Because they have an properly established brand identity. That is out of our scope, something for the brand strategist to tackle. (there may or mayn't be an article on this in the future.)</p>

		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="inset0 container">
		<h1>container</h1>
		<p>Containers play a crucial role in web design as they help structure and organize content, making it visually
			appealing and user-friendly.</p>
		<div class="inset1">
			<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
			<p>Collection of things that can apply to all containers</p>
			<div class="inset2">
				<h3>Shadow</h3>
				<p>Intense or timid you should add shadows, this adds a little visual complexity and realism.</p>
			</div>
			<!-- <div class="inset2">
					<h3></h3>
				</div> -->
		</div>
		<div class="inset1">
			<h2>Headers</h2>
			<p>The header on a website serves as a critical component that plays multiple important functions. It's usually
				located at
				the top of the webpage and is one of the first elements users see when they visit a site.. It contains all
				the
				basic information about a website so that users can understand what it offers in seconds.</p>
			<div class="inset2">
				<h3>Logo</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>Header is often a prime location to display the website's logo. It helps users quickly identify the website, establish its identity, and reinforce its brand image.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>On small displays, consider a symmetrical navigation bar with a centered logo in combination with icon buttons on the left and right sides.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Make sure that the logo is recognizable at same time space-saving on all device classes. Block
							the display of certain parts of the logo it they take too much space.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Include on all pages & link to homepage as web users are used to clicking on the logo to go back to the homepage.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="inset2">
				<h3>Main navigation (large devices)</h3>
				<p>main navigation allows you to switch between sections & pages of the website. Allowing users to find
					their way around and gives an overview of the contents of a website.</p>
				<h4>Current page indicator</h4>
				<p>Highlighted to indicate the page/section the website user is on. Usually using a darker font color, bold
					font, and a line.</p>
				<h4>Menu items</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>Aligned, make sure all menu items fit in a line.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Category names must reflect the content of the website, functioning as a concise index of its
							contents.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Make sure to name them appropriately, terms like "Service" and "solutions" are too vague while
							niche terms that the target group does not immediately understand is problematic as well.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>No more than 7 menu items, maximum of 3 words per menu item.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Arrange the items meaningfully.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>No "home" link, logo links to home already.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>No link to external website in the menu.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Use fixed navigation (sticky navigation) on very long pages. Hide this navigation when scrolling
							down increasing the area available for the content of the website to display.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="inset2">
				<h3>Hamburger Menus ≡ (small devices)</h3>
				<p>For smaller devices hamburger menus are used when there is not enough space for the main navigation. On large screen devices it's used for concealing less significant links that hold relevance to users only under specific situations. This approach aids in sidestepping a congested primary navigation interface. When users tap or click on the hamburger icon, it triggers an event to expand or reveal the hidden menu.</p>
				<h4>colapse icon</h4>
				<p>To close the hamburger menu once open.</p>
				<h4>Menu items</h4>
				<p>similar to how it's in Main navigation</p>
				<h4>Container</h4>
				<p>This contain the menu which slides in from the side of the screen (often from the left) or appears as an overlay on top of the existing
				content.</p>
				<h4>Slide in animation</h4>
				<p>This animation effect can vary based on the design and implementation, usually is done with a smooth animation.</p>
				<h4>Don't save too much</h4>
				<p>Don't shove all the menu items into the hamburger if there is ample space. For users might not notice the icon, all these links are now one click away addinng friction, less ctas to attract users curiosity.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="inset2">
				<h3>Header background</h3>
				<p>The background styling or image of the header, which can set the tone for the website's design and branding.</p>
				<h4>Focalpoint for all</h4>
				<p>Ensure that the primary focus of the image is visible within the viewport across all device classes, including
				smartphones, tablets, desktop PCs, and notebooks.</p>
				<h4>Compatible mood & colors</h4>
				<p>Make sure the colors and mood match with that of the overall website</p>
			</div>
			<div class="inset2">
				<h3>miscellaneous</h3>
				<h4>Search Bar & search icon</h4>
				<p>A search box or a search icon that enables users to search for specific content or products within the website.</p>
				<h4>Contact Information</h4>
				<p>Adding a phone number, email address, physical address, or links to social media profiles to make it easy for visitors to get
				in touch or follow the website on social platforms</p>
				<h4>Language or Region Selector</h4>
				<p>If the website caters to an international audience, a language or region selector may be included to allow users to
				choose their preferred language or region.</p>
				<h4>User Account/Login/Register</h4>
				<p>Links or buttons that provide access to user account-related functions, such as login, registration, or profile
				management.</p>
				<h4>Notifications or Alerts</h4>
				<p>In some cases, the header may display notifications or alerts, such as new messages, updates, or important
				announcements.</p>
				<h4>Site-wide Messages</h4>
				<p>Temporary messages or banners may appear in the header to convey important announcements or promotions.</p>
				<h4>Cart or Basket Icon</h4>
				<p>For e-commerce websites, a cart or basket icon may be present to indicate the number of items in the shopping cart.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="inset1">
			<h2>Sections</h2>
			<p>Sections serve to segment a page's content into logical blocks, employing distinct background colors, images, or white
			space to delineate various content types. This organized division proves crucial for pages covering diverse topics.</p>
