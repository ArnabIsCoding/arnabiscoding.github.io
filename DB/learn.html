				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>You can open the sidebar for index. I am learning myself so it will take a while to complete. The font used is called <a href="https://opendyslexic.org/" class="noo">opendyslexic</a>. The code snippets are shared using <a href="https://asciinema.org/" class="noo">asciinema</a> you can pause and copy the code from there. If you find any misinformation on this website please let me know.</p>

				<p>We expect you to already have docker engine and WSL (for windows device) installed and set up.</p>
				   <h3  id="1-1">AuthZ vs AuthN </h3>
				   <p>
					<a target="_blank" href="https://auth0.com/intro-to-iam/what-is-authentication">AuthN (Authentication)</a> = it is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system, typically through credentials like passwords or biometrics. <br>
					<a target="_blank" href="https://auth0.com/intro-to-iam/what-is-authorization">AuthZ (Authorization)</a> = it is determines what actions or resources a user is permitted to access after their identity has been authenticated, enforcing access control policies. Most common access is CRUD which stands for Create, read, Update & Delete. <br>
					<a target="_blank" href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0?</a> = It is one of many authentication and authorization platform used by developers to implement secure access to their applications via features like single sign-on and multi-factor authentication. <br>

				   </p>
				   <h3  id="1-2">SQL vs NoSQL </h3>
				   <p>TL;DR: SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two types of database management systems. SQL databases, like MySQL and PostgreSQL, are relational databases with a structured schema (blueprint that defines the organization of data within a database), supporting ACID (atomic, consistent, isolated, durable) transactions and providing strong consistency. NoSQL databases, like MongoDB and Cassandra, are non-relational and schema-less, offering flexibility in data models and horizontal scalability preserving the fidelity of data. SQL databases are suitable for structured data and complex queries, while NoSQL databases excel in handling unstructured or semi-structured data and high-volume transactions with distributed architectures. The choice between SQL and NoSQL depends on factors like data structure, scalability needs, and the nature of the application.</p>
				   <h3  id="1-5">Hands on MongoDB and Mongo-Express </h3>
				   <p>
					official <a target="_blank" href="https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo">docker-compose image for MongoDB</a>,
					<pre>
<code># Use root/example as user/password credentials
	version: '3.1'
	
	services:
	
	  mongo:
		image: mongo
		restart: always
		environment:
		  MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: root
		  MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
	
	  mongo-express:
		image: mongo-express
		restart: always
		ports:
		  - 8081:8081
		environment:
		  ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME: root
		  ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINPASSWORD: example
		  ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_URL: mongodb://root:example@mongo:27017/
</code>
					</pre>
					Our edited verison,
					<pre>
<code>
	version: "3.1"

	services:
	  mongo:
		image: mongo
		restart: always
		ports:
		  - 27017:27017
		environment:
		  MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: arnab
		  MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: A12345
	
	  mongo-express:
		image: mongo-express
		restart: always
		ports:
		  - 8082:8081
		environment:
		  ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME: arnab
		  ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINPASSWORD: A12345
		  ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_URL: mongodb://arnab:A12345@mongo:27017/
		  ME_CONFIG_OPTIONS_EDITORTHEME: "ambiance"
		  ME_CONFIG_BASICAUTH_USERNAME: "arnab"
		  ME_CONFIG_BASICAUTH_PASSWORD: "A12345"
</code>
					</pre>
					we are changing the port, adding our username, password. We are also adding a custom theme to Mongo-Express which is a web-based MongoDB admin interface written in Node. js, Express. js, and Bootstrap3.
				   </p>
				   <p>Now to get this running follow the commands below,</p>
				   <div class="asciinema" id="mongoComposeplayer"></div>
				   <p>Opening the docker engine interface we see,</p>
				   <img src="./assets/pic/Screenshot 2024-03-25 232336.webp" alt="" srcset="">
				   <p>As it stands now we have,</p>
				   <code>mongo database server is running at http://localhost:27017/</code><br>
				   <code>mongo express running at http://localhost:8082/</code>
				   <p>As Mongo express is the interface we will visit that link,</p>
				   <img src="./assets/pic/Screenshot 2024-03-25 232223.webp" alt="" srcset="">
				   <p>It prompts you to input the username and password which is "arnab" and "A12345" in my case according to my configuration.</p>
				   <img src="./assets/pic/Screenshot 2024-03-25 232417.webp" alt="" srcset="">
				   <h3  id="1-4">JSON vs BSON</h3>
				   <p>If you wish to nerd out you should read the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/basics/bson">MongoDB docs on BSON</a>.</p>
				   <p>TL;DR: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and BSON (Binary JSON) are both data interchange formats used primarily in web development and data storage. JSON is human-readable and lightweight, making it easy to parse and generate. However, BSON is a binary-encoded serialization of JSON-like documents, offering advantages like efficiency in storage and transmission, support for additional data types, and faster parsing. BSON is commonly used in databases like MongoDB for efficient storage and retrieval of data, especially in large-scale applications where performance is crucial.</p>
				   <p>Say we have a json file called arnab.json,</p>
				   <pre>
<code>
	{
	  "firstName": "Arnab",
	  "lastName": "Goswami",
	
	  "Address": {
		"City": "Malda",
		"ZipPIN": "73210",
		"Country": "IN"
	  },
	  "Peoms": {
		"P1": "Some struggling to be seen, some to disappear.",
		"P2": "Expect to lose and fear failure, desire to win and prepare for war."
	  }
	}
	
</code>
				   </pre>
				   <p>Let's make a new database on our server</p>
				   <img src="./assets/pic/Screenshot 2024-03-27 150020.webp" alt="" srcset="">
				   <img src="./assets/pic/Screenshot 2024-03-27 150111.webp" alt="" srcset="">
				   <p>Click on view to open the db and create a new file</p>
				   <img src="./assets/pic/Screenshot 2024-03-27 150201.webp" alt="" srcset="">
				   <img src="./assets/pic/Screenshot 2024-03-27 150227.webp" alt="" srcset="">
				   <p>Formating the JSON for the input it would look like this,</p>
				   <pre>
<code>
	{
		"_id": ObjectId(),
	  "firstName": "Arnab",
	  "lastName": "Goswami",
	
	  "Address": {
		"City": "Malda",
		"ZipPIN": "73210",
		"Country": "IN"
	  },
	  "Peoms": {
		"P1": "Some struggling to be seen, some to disappear.",
		"P2": "Expect to lose and fear failure, desire to win and prepare for war."
	  }
	}
	
</code>
				   </pre>
				   <p>after we paste the code and save it shows up on the gui. You can see the data got populated by itself and no schema was required (as mongoDB is NoSQL). This data stored here is in BSON format.</p>
				   <img src="./assets/pic/Screenshot 2024-03-27 150538.webp" alt="" srcset="">
				   <h3  id="1-3">Understanding Nosql records/documents </h3>
				   <p>from there if we were to change some data say my last name. I can click on the field and we can edit from there.</p>
				   <p>As we can see unlike SQL we don't have any restrictions with the schema like how many characters a specific field can be.</p>
